#### 📊 Benchmark Results

Qualitative comparison against state-of-the-art methods (FUEL, Star-Searcher, EPIC, etc.) in diverse environments ...







##  🤝 Open Source Commitment

We are committed to reproducible research.  As with our previous work on **[LAEA: A 2D LiDAR-Assisted UAV Exploration Algorithm](https://github.com/Poaos/LAEA)**, the full source code for **STEAM** will be released **immediately upon acceptance**.
